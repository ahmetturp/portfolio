## Event Management Application

This application was designed to help visitors easily track an organization's regularly scheduled events. I developed the app using the **OutSystems** low-code platform.

Through the **web application**, users can create event sessions covering one or multiple days, enter session details, and add session speakers. Event sponsors can be added and categorized as gold, silver, or bronze.

With the **mobile application**, participants can track past and upcoming sessions via the agenda, view speaker biographies, ask questions before the event, and provide feedback afterward.

# hupiko - An Employee Engagement App

hupiko is an application I designed to enhance interaction between colleagues. I developed this app using the **Kuika** low-code platform.

Through the **web application**, panel administrators (such as HR personnel) can share announcements and send instant notifications.

Employees can use the **mobile application** to share their own posts and comment on others' posts. Additionally, they can personalize their profiles to showcase their hobbies and skills to colleagues. This allows employees to easily connect with coworkers who share similar interests.
