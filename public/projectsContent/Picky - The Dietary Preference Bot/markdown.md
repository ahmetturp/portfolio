# Project Summary

In this group project, we created a chatbot that can help users decide what they want to eat. The application applies these opportunities while focusing on different allergies and dietary preferences while aiming to satisfy the need with care and precision. We followed the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) [1] and design guidelines [2]. For example, when any information is missing for the bot to find a restaurant, it asks more naturally (and in different ways each time) instead of something like "the 'price range' field is missing".

We used the following tools and frameworks during the development phase.

- **Facebook for Developers:** The platform enables developers with a Facebook profile to connect their codes and projects to access data and using core functions of Facebook by using APIs, SDKs, or plug-ins.
- **Google Dialogflow:** Dialogflow is a platform that delivers a new way to interact with products and interfaces powered by AI. It enables the opportunity to build bots on top of existing products and services with the use of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engine to process and understand its input. It runs on the Google Cloud platform with no limits when it comes to users.
- **Google Firebase:** Google Firebase is a platform that delivers many different structures; in our case, we have mainly used its database functionality and direct Google app implementation. Firebase delivers a suite of different premium options on storage and data generation, and it can be used to supplement any scale development application.
