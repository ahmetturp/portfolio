# Project Summary

We automated a routine scan-index-store service bureau operation for one of the biggest cement producers in Turkey. The main purpose of the operation was to archive "**Transportation Permits**" and related weight receipt of that document which can be accessed from the SAP system of the General Directory of Forestry.

**Before the automation**, our customer had to go through the following procedures:

1. Scan the "Transportation Permits"
2. Open the scanned documents, extract 2 different pieces of information (document Sequence and Number)
3. Write extracted information to an excel file
4. Open the SAP system to query and download the related receipt
5. Store the Permit and related Receipt by creating folders in the Windows file system.

As anyone can tell, this approach is old-fashioned and highly prone to user error. We offered to utilize **Hyland's RPA** solution to extract the data, execute the file system operations (create folders, move files etc.), and integrate other systems (SAP and OnBase). As a result, the only work our customer had to do was to scan the documents and let the robots do the work!

For this project, I was responsible for designing the whole solution, including:

- Designing the project's software and hardware architecture,
- Configuring the robot,
- Configuring the digital archival hierarchy (defining document types, creating automated folder tree structure and Workflow),
- Designing the dashboard reports,
- Documenting the processes (diagrams, how to use documents etc.)

## The workflow and the architecture of the system

1. **Permits are scanned:** The physical documents are scanned and saved to a shared folder for robots to access and process them.
2. **Import the scanned files:** RPA work starts here. The robot looks for the PDF files at 13:00 (scan operators finish the scanning job before that time). If there are any files, the robot queues these files. Then another robot(s) can start processing the files in this queue.
3. **Run OCR on the document:** The robot opens the PDF file and extracts the required information (**Sequence** and **Number**).

   > ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** When extracting the Sequence and Number, we only expect numerical characters. The OCR engine sometimes can't tell the difference between the "O" character and the "0" (zero) number. We replace such characters to increase the OCR accuracy! ("A" to "4", "I" to "1" etc.)

4. **Query the SAP system:** Every permit has a related "**Weighbridge Receipt**" stored in the SAP system (The receipt is an XML document that has been automatically generated by the weighbridge after the vehicle's weight has been measured.). The Sequence and Number information on both documents are identical.  
   Hyland RPA offers API-level integration with the SAP systems. So we query the permits to find their related receipts easily.

5. **Send the documents to OnBase:** The robot then uploads these two documents to OnBase along with Sequence and Number keywords (metadata).

6. **OnBase Platform:** OnBase ECM platform is where the documents are stored.

   The uploaded documents trigger a workflow process that transitions the documents into "**Successful**" and "**Failed**" queues:

   - The "Successful" queue is where the permits and receipts matched during the SAP query. This queue is for information purposes only and cleaned is automatically daily.
   - The "Failed" queue is where the uploaded permits have no related receipt found during the SAP query. This is due to OCR extraction on the permit having produced no results OR wrong results.  
     Users can take the "Index the document manually" action to enter the keywords manually to search the related receipt. The search is executed within the OnBase screens. So the users don't need to open a separate SAP screen.

## Benefits

The customer saves time and money by automating & minimizing the manual work. Also, automating the creation of the folder hierarchy eliminates the human-error.
